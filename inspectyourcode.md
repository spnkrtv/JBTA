# Inspect your code

IIntelliJ IDEA has a set of features for code inspections that helps you find and fix misspellings, potential bugs, and incorrect data input data. You can run inspections for all files in a project or define desirable [scopes](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-scopes-and-file-colors.html).

Each detected issue gets a [severity level](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-inspection-severities.html) indicating its significance. IntelliJ IDEA has a set of predefined severity levels, but you can also configure your own by using [inspection profiles](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/customizing-profiles.html).

<ol>
<li>Click **IntelliJ IDEA** in the upper left corner, then go to **Preferences** or use the `âŒ˜,` shortcut.</li>

</ol>

## Analyze a file

IntelliJ IDEA automatically analyzes your code in the editor and highlights detected issues while writing the code.

<ol>
<li>If you have a syntax error, you will see a warning icon on the issue line. In the top right corner, you will see the widget with the numbers of detected issues of each severity:
